### Hi there 👋

This is my firt time using GitHub. Some of it was easy, some of it not so easy.

I visited the awesome-public-datasets repository and saw several that were interesting to me. I selected BarroLeeDataSet which is the Barro Lee Educational Attainment Dataset. I am interested in the way educational attainment varies around the world, and inside our own country/state/community because I think the way we measure “attainment” is open to conversation. The dataset could be used to measure progress over time, particularly in response to educational initiatives for a specific population/location. When I tried to look at their metadata, I got an error that the file was not found. I was able to open the data files (excel) to see some of the data and also get information on the variables. However, I wanted to see the way metadata looked on GitHub, so I went to the Cooper Hewitt Collection data set and looked at their metadata. That was Dublin Core with a few extended terms, one of which was data_dictionary. That is a great addition so catalogers know what controlled vocabulary was used. 

For the Barro Lee Data Set, there were no barriers to access. It might be hard to find without the metadata, though. I opened a few of the excel files and they would have fit in google sheets, but I wonder if all of the data sets are similarly sized. 

I used the Search function for digital-preservation, browsed, and then starred two repositories. One looked really interesting because it is a public repository (not all are) of Digital Preservation Software for the National Archives of Australia. It makes sense that they would keep that software here. The other repository I starred was seanofw/spacemonger1 which is an archive of an older version of that software. Spacemonger is a "cleanup" tool that frees up storage on a hard drive.
